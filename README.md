# NBA Stats app

A simple native application for quickly looking up season statistics for NBA players. This application is built mainly for personal use, as the official NBA website is frustratingly slow.

The application is built with electron and react, and can be compiled to:

- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux

This application uses the [balldontlie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/), which is updated with live statistics every 10 minutes.
